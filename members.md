## Introduction
Application group features allow each registered user to create and belong to multiple groups.

- The Current Group ​
Every user in application has a "current group", if belongs to a group. This is the group that the user is actively viewing resources for. For example, if you are inserting data in a calendar, your application would display the calendar events for the user's current group.

- Switching Groups
A user may switch their current group via the "group switcher" menu available within the navigation bar.

- Member Management
Group members may be added and removed from a group via "Group Panel" section `Members`, must have permissions `group:users:view` and `group:user:create`.

- Invitations ​
For new member you have to send invitation emails to users that are invited to groups. If the user does not have an account, the invitation email can instruct them to create an account and accept the invitation. Or, if the user already has an account, they can accept or ignore the invitation.

Once you send user invitations, users that are invited to groups will receive an invitation email with a link to accept the group invitation. Users will not be full members of the group until the invitation is accepted.
