[[TOC]]

## Introduction

Application has a Calendar feature. It allows group members to follow their work schedule, with multiple variations of settings, such as: projects, tasks, templates or clients.
Each `group` has his own calendar, so if a user has more than one `group` than he are not allowed to read records from other group in current group calendar.
Certain days can be blocked for members who don't have the `group:calendar:override_date_lock` permission, which allows them to insert even if the date is blocked or you can use `Future Entries`, no one will be allowed to insert if the desired date is in the future. If necessary, you can activate the `Report approval` function in 'group settings'.
