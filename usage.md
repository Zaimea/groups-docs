## Meet Zaimea

Zaimea is an application that helps you to simplify the reporting of working hours, having different facilities and continuously working on improving and adding new functions.

Don't need to write code or worry about having to pay for a IT team, with us, you can even help improve the application by requesting to add new features or reporting errors.

> {note} The application can be used on your own or within a group/company. You can find more details by accessing [zaimea.com/prices](https://zaimea.com/prices)

## Why Zaimea?

Many of the functions you need are already implemented here and will be improved. New facilities will be added.

#### A Progressive Application

We like to call Zaimea a "progressive" application. 
By that, we mean that Zaimea grows with you. 
We always try to bring new features and improve the operation. 
If the needs are not met and you want a new feature, you can contact us and give more details and we will try to add it as quickly as possible.

## How it started?

In principle, I made a `PHP` application for personal use, very small where I only kept a record of my working days, then I added more features, such as: start/end, breaks, notes.
Then I started wanting more to make it even easier, I added a calculation of total hours worked per month. Working with several companies I also added a project system, pdf generation and so on.
So I advanced to a fairly large variety of features and tested on my own, throughout the development.
