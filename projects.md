# Projects

[[TOC]]

## Introduction

Projects are available in Application when you use either projects or projects and tasks tracking mode. You can set the tracking mode on the `Group settings` page.

## Manage Projects

To manage projects use the Projects tab. Members in roles having the `group:project:create` access right (default Co-manager, Manager, Top manager and Owner roles) can create new projects with the `Create` button. They can also edit or delete projects using the Edit and Delete icons in the project table if they have access right.

## "Projects and Tasks" Tracking Mode

If you use projects and tasks tracking mode you can also assign tasks to projects. Assigning only specific tasks to projects helps to reduce clutter for users when they enter their work time.
